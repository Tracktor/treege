**_This directory contains reusable Feature Components.
A Feature Component is a concept inspired by Redux in which
all logic required for a feature is co-located to a single directory.
A Feature Component is often composed of many other components,
either local or shared. The same is true for all resources:
utils, types, hooks, and so on._**

**_Feature Components often include side effects._**

**_f using Redux, and interacts with the Store,
the Feature Component will include a slice file
that defines the “slice” of the Redux Store the feature represents._**
